### Chapter I- Foundations

### Summary


- Concurrent programming allows us to build more responsive software
- Concurrent progrmas can also provide increased speedupo when running on multiple processors
- We can increase throughtpu even when we heave only one processors if our concurrent programming makes effective use of the I/O wait times.
- Go provides us with goroutines, which are lightweight constructs for modeling concurrent executions.
- Go provides us with abstractions, such as channles, that enable concurrent executions to communicate and synchronize
- Go allows us the choice of building our concurrent application either using the communication sequential rpocessess style model
or using the classical primitives.
- Using a CSP-style model, we reduce the chance of certain types of concurrent errors, however, for certain problems using the classical
primitives will give us better results.
